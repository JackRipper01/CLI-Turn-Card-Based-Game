### üÉè CLI Card Battle: A Turn-Based Game for OOP & C# Mastery

This project is a classic **console-based, turn-based card game**, meticulously developed entirely in **C#**. It serves as a practical exploration and application of fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** and core C# language features, demonstrating the design and implementation of interactive game logic within a command-line environment.

*Showcases strong command of C#, OOP paradigms, and foundational game logic development.*

**Key Learning & Technical Highlights:**
*   **Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Application:** Deeply applied core OOP principles including Encapsulation (e.g., encapsulating card properties and deck states), Inheritance (e.g., defining various card types inheriting from a base `Card` class), and Polymorphism (e.g., enabling diverse card abilities through method overriding).
*   **C# Language Proficiency:** Gained hands-on experience with advanced C# syntax, data structures (such as `List<T>` for decks and `Queue<T>` for turn order), control flow mechanisms, and basic error handling for robust application development.
*   **Turn-Based Game Logic Implementation:** Developed a clear and effective game loop to manage player turns, handle actions (e.g., playing cards, attacking), resolve game states, and define victory conditions within the console.
*   **Modular Architecture:** Structured the game into distinct, cohesive, and manageable components (e.g., `Player`, `Card`, `Deck`, `GameManager`) to promote code reusability, maintainability, and extensibility.
*   **Console-Based User Interface:** Designed and implemented an interactive command-line interface for intuitive user input and clear display of game state, focusing on effective text-based feedback.

This project represents a solid foundation in **C# programming**, **Object-Oriented design patterns**, and **basic game development principles**, built for clarity and robust learning.
